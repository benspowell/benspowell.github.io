                                    <p>This project was made as a part of a group assignment for a Database Systems class. 
                                    It's essentially a mock web store control panel, with a order form shop section. <br><br>The main emphasis for this project was on planning, constructing and implementing a database from scratch. MySql was used for the database management, and the site uses php to retrieve and alter data from the database.
                                    <br><br>As a long(ish) term project, it allowed me to become familiar with the process of planning, implementing, and delivering a project based on limited requirements. 
                                    <br><br> You can view the project site <a href="https://congostore.000webhostapp.com/">here.</a>

                                    <p>A car companion app made for Honda's <a href="resources/Honda_Challenge.pdf">Connected Vehicle Challenge</a> in the <a href="http://hack.osu.edu/2018">2018 OHI/O Hackathon</a>. The app aims to supports responsible driving habits by collecting user's driving data (taken from the phone's sensors), providing maintenance reminders/guidance. It uses Bluetooth to easily integrate into driversâ€™ lives.<br><br>The project is a cross-platform app for iOS and Android and was created created using NativeScript and Angular.
                                    <br><br>My group successfully completed a functioning project within 24 hours and submitted it to compete against 100+ other teams.

                                    <p>A semester-long engineering project completed by every first-year engineering student at OSU. The purpose of the project is to create a vehicle which runs on a suspended metal rail, hooking up a cart and carrying it to designated stops on the rail.<br><br>An arduino controller was used alongside physical components for the frame, propeller motors, servo motor, etc. The project included several extensive technical reports aimed to imitate large-scale engineering projects. MATLAB was used to analyze data taken from various tests of the vehicle.<br><br>The project was successfully completed and included a final test, a poster, a video, a presentation, and several reports and coding projects, all of which can be viewed on the <a href="https://u.osu.edu/engr118201spr2017rightbrothers/">project website</a>.
